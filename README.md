ShokoMetadata.bundle
====================
This is a plex library metadata currently written **only** for TV shows.

## NOTE:
This fork of Cazzar's ShokoMetadata Agent/Scanner is mostly me poking around trying to implement things that I personally want that may or may not be of value to others.
UNLIKE Cazzar, however, I only have a vague clue of what the hell I'm actually doing, so if you insist on trying this for youself, just know there is a good chance your machine may violently detonate, hatch into a three-headed duck, or achieve sentience and take over the world. It could also do nothing. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

## Notes

- Use with Shoko Series scanner, installed into the `Scanners/Series` folder.
- DO change the preferences to match what you have.

# Changes from Cazzar's ShokoMetadata Agent/Scanner
